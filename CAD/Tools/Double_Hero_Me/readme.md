## Hot End Modifications

To have quick change-ability for PTFE lined hot ends, it is recommended to do the "washer fix" that adds a section of captive PTFE tube inside the hot end, trapped below a washer.  This allows the Bowden tube above the washer to be easily removed without worrying about perfectly re-seating the tube after an Inter tool change.

Originally by Luke Hatfield, [CHEP has a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tCxO17XZtw) about it, and you can find the necessary files on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3203831).  The fix can also improve printing overall, so its recommended to do.
