## Hotend Modifications

To have quick change-ability for PTFE lined hotends, it is recommended to do the "washer fix" that adds a section of captive PTFE tube inside the hotend, trapped below a washer.  This allows the bowden tube above the washer to be easily removed without worrying about perfectly re-seating the tube after an Inter tool change.
