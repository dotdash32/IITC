## Caveats

This is not optimized for support-less printing, like the main Hero Me.  

### Needed Materials

- 1x`Hotend_Mount`
- 1x `Kinematic_Mount`
- 1x Creality MK8 Hot ends
- 1x 40mm Fan (hot end cooling)
- 1x Bowden tubes
- 1x `Dsub_Cap`
- 1x 9 Pin D sub connectors (male)
- 1x `Symmetric_Duct`
- 1x 4010 Blower fans (part cooling)
- 3x 8mm M3 SHCS
- 3x 5mm M3 SHCS
- 2x 16mm M3 SHCS
- 6x Thin M3 nuts

## Hot End Modifications

To have quick change-ability for PTFE lined hot ends, it is recommended to do the "washer fix" that adds a section of captive PTFE tube inside the hot end, trapped below a washer.  This allows the Bowden tube above the washer to be easily removed without worrying about perfectly re-seating the tube after an Inter tool change.

Originally by Luke Hatfield, [CHEP has a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tCxO17XZtw) about it, and you can find the necessary files on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3203831).  The fix can also improve printing overall, so its recommended to do.
