# Spool Holder

Colloqiually called the "Spool Whale" becasuse of the whale tail like design, a purpose built dual spool holder with provisions for in line filament runout sensors and dual Creality style extruders

## Needed Materials

- `Bottom_Board_Small` (dxf to be laser cut)
    - prtinable STL Coming Soon^(tm)
- `Spool_Whale_Lower`
- `Spool_Whale_Upper`
- 2x 12mm M5 SHCS
- 2x M5 Tnuts (from stock spool holder)
- 3x 12mm M3 SHCS
- 3x M3 thin nuts
- 2x Creality Extruders (steppers, extruder tops)
- 2x Bowden Tubes

## Optional Filament Runout Sensors

This is for one sensor, so for two, double everything.

- `Fil_Runout_Bottom`
- `Fil_Runout_Top`
- 4x 12mm M3 SHCS
- 4x M3 thin nuts
- Short PTFE tube
- Microswitch with roller lever
- Wiring harness

There are some printablity problems with the filament runout sensors relating to the bowden tubes, so be warned.

Also, an upgrade to BMG style extruders is soft-planned for higher performance.
