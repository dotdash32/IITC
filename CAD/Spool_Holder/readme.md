# Spool Holder

Colloquially called the "Spool Whale" because of the whale tail like design, a purpose built dual spool holder with provisions for in line filament runout sensors and dual Creality style extruders.

## Base Holder

Simple holder, includes two extruder mounts (Creality MK10 style) and dual roll filament holder.

This also adopts the PTFE liner from Voron, so that spools are not in contact with printed plastic, but instead slippery PTFE during printing.

### Needed Materials

- `Bottom_Board_Small` (dxf to be laser cut)
  - printable STL Coming Soon
- `Spool_Whale_Lower`
- `Spool_Whale_Upper`
- 2x 12mm M5 SHCS
- 2x M5 T nuts (from stock spool holder)
- 3x 12mm M3 SHCS
- 3x M3 thin nuts
- 2x Creality Extruders (steppers, extruder tops)
- 2x Bowden Tubes

## Optional Filament Runout Sensors

This is for one sensor, so for two, double everything.

### Needed materials

- `Fil_Runout_Bottom`
- `Fil_Runout_Top`
- 4x 12mm M3 SHCS
- 4x M3 thin nuts
- Short PTFE tube
- Microswitch with roller lever
- Wiring harness

There are some printability problems with the filament runout sensors relating to the Bowden tubes, so be warned.

Also, an upgrade to BMG style extruders is soft-planned for higher performance.
