# Top Hat Hardware Dev Kit

Files related to the Kinematic Mount and creating new tools.  Included are STEP and Fusion files of a simplified mount.
The files contain the `Top_Hat` in it's unmodified form, as well as the infrastructure it mounts to.

The E plate and moving mount are included, but at lower detail so less powerful computers (aka Dotdash's) can create add-ons more easily.
