# Top Hat Hardware Dev Kit

Files related to the Kinematic Mount and creating new tools.  Included are STEP and Fusion files of a simplified mount.
The files contain the `Top_Hat` in it's unmodified form, as well as the infrastructure it mounts to.

The E plate and moving mount are included, but at lower detail so less powerful computers (aka Dotdash's) can create add-ons more easily.
These files are intended to simplify and ease the creation of new tools.
Rather than needing the supply side (Dotdash) to create them, please make your own and pull request them in!
