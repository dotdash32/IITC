# X Stop

A modified X limit switch holder to increase clearance.

The stock Ender 3 X stop has a QR code and sticks out really far.  This is a clearance problem for some dual extruders, since the part needs to swing out of the way during tool changes.

## Needed materials

- 1x `New_Limit_switch_holder`
- 1x X stop micro switch
- 2x 5mm M3 SHCS
- 4x 12mm M3 SHCS

Unfortunately, this part needs support.
