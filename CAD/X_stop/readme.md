# X Stop

A modified X limit switch holder to increase clearance.

The stock Ender 3 X stop has a QR code and sticks out really far.  This is a clearance problem for some dual extruders, since the part needs to swing out of the way during tool changes.

## Needed Materials

- 1x `Slim_X_Stop`
- 1x X stop micro switch
- 2x 5mm M3 SHCS
- 4x 25mm M3 Flat Head Screws

## Supported Version

Older version that needs support to print.
This model is more useful if you only have short SHCS (I had an Amazon mixed bag for prototyping) on hand, but otherwise, use the more updated version and the countersunk screws.

- 1x `Slim_X_Stop_Support`
- 1x X stop micro switch
