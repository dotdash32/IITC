* 5 8mm M3 SHCS
* 4 Thin M3 Nuts

## Direct without Horn

An old version of the servo mount.
It mounts directly to the 25 tooth servo gear, hence the "Direct" name.
Needs either high precision, or to melt the teeth profile in.

To melt, something like acrylic cement (for PLA, not recommended plastic) can be used.
Apply the cement liberally to the point of indentation, and then press onto the servo gear.
Let it set until dry, and you have a nice set of embedded teeth!
