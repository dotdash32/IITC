# Tool Setup

This folder includes files related to Tool setup.

See the [Tool Setup Proceedure](/Tool_setup/Tool_setup_proceedure.md) for a walk through of how to setup a tool, which links to the example Gcode for a [pen plotter](/Tool_setup/PlotterHead.gcode).

This folder mainly acts as a space to store all Dotdash's personal tool offsets, and track them.  They are stored in here and also on the printer SD card.

Eventually, this folder should also include links to video walkthroughs of how to assemble different tools.
