# Main Tilters

The main bulk of the project is here, these are what do the dirty work.
There are 3 possible combinations, and each need slightly different materials.

## Common Parts

The topmost section is common to all tilters, so any set of tools can be attached to any tilter.

* 1x `Nut_Trap`
* 6x 8mm M3 SHCS
* 6x Thin M3 Nuts

## 1 Position Tilter

This tilter doesn't move, but gives any printer Inter-changes and automatic probing for just a few parts.
It only needs the printed part, but it is somewhat diffiult to print cleanly.
Under development to print better.

* 1x `1_Pos_main`

## 2 Position Tilter

This is the mainstay of the project, 2 tools per tool group for intra-switches.

* 1x `2_Pos_Main`
* 1x `Stationary_Mount`
* 1x `Bearing_Internal_Spacer`
* 1x 20mm M5 SHCS
* 2x 105zz Bearings
* 1x Nylock M5 Nut
* 1x 5mm M3 SHCS

## 4 Position Tilter

This is not finished!
But in order to keep this option open, it needs to be at least partially designed for from the start.
It does not currently have provisions for a tilting cable, but that will hopefully change soon.

This enables front and back tilting as well, so 2 Position Tool Groups will work natively as well. 
The issue is that it extends back and would collide with the vertical 2040 beams on the Ender 3.

* 1x `4_Pos_Lower`
* 1x `4_Pos_Upper`
* 1x `Stationary_Mount`
* 2x `Bearing_Internal_Spacer`
* 2x 20mm M5 SHCS
* 4x 105zz Bearings
* 2x Nylock M5 Nut
* 1x 5mm M3 SHCS (subject to change)
